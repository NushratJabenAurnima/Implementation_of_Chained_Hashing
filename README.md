## Problem Statement
**Hash tables serves as an efficient data structure for storing and retrieving information 
in computer memory. There are different types of Hashing such as Open hashing also 
known as Closed Addressing and Closed Hashing or Open addressing. The given code shows Open Hashing along with chainig method to implement the hash table, To handle collisions Open hashing uses linked list. Also division method is used to determine hash keys.**

## The system allows the following features:
**. User Input**

**. Create Hash Table**

**. Display The Hash Table**

**. Delete Data From The Hash Tablee**

**. Search Data From The Hash Table**

**. Terminate the program**

  ## The system contains the following functions:
  **. initial()**
  
  **. insert()**
  
  **. Delete()**
  
  **. search()**
  
  **. display()**
